# SecureText ECE 572 Assignment Series

This repository contains series of assignments for the ECE 572 in Summer 2025, by Dr. Ardeshir Shojaeinasab. We will be using a console-based messenger application called "SecureText". Students will progressively identify vulnerabilities, demonstrate attacks, and implement security fixes across three assignments.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment series, you will gain hands-on experience with:
- Common security vulnerabilities and attack techniques
- Cryptographic implementations and their pitfalls
- Network security and traffic analysis
- Authentication mechanisms and multi-factor authentication
- Zero Trust security principles
- Asymmetric cryptography and digital signatures

## Assinment Structure

This hands-on practice is divided into **three assignments**, each building upon the previous one:

### Assignment 1: Foundations of Security Vulnerabilities
**Focus**: Basic security concepts, password security, and network attacks
- **Task 1**: Vulnerability Analysis (analyze the provided insecure messenger)
- **Task 2**: Password Security (hashing, salting)
- **Task 3**: Network Security (eavesdropping, message tampering, MAC attacks)

### Assignment 2: Advanced Authentication and Authorization
**Focus**: Modern authentication mechanisms and access control
- **Task 4**: Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP implementation)
- **Task 5**: OAuth Integration (third-party authentication)
- **Task 6**: Zero Trust Implementation (identity verification, least privilege)

### Assignment 3: Advanced Cryptography and Secure Communication
**Focus**: End-to-end security and cryptographic protocols
- **Task 7**: Asymmetric Cryptography (RSA/ECDSA key exchange)
- **Task 8**: Digital Signatures (message authentication and non-repudiation)
- **Task 9**: Secure Protocol Design (putting it all together)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Solid knowledge of cryptography and security scenarios explained in the class, ECE 572
- Familiarity with command-line tools
- Git installed on your system

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ECE572_Summer2025_SecureText.git
   cd ECE572_Summer2025_SecureText
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b assignmentX-solutions # or whatever name you prefer for the branch. In this name X is the assignment index
   ```

```

## Base Application

The repository includes a fully functional but **intentionally insecure** messenger application (`src/securetext.py`) that serves as the foundation for all assignments. This application includes:

- Account creation and authentication
- Real-time messaging via TCP sockets
- User management and online status
- JSON-based client-server protocol

### Running the Base Application

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python3 src/securetext.py server
   ```

2. **Start a client** (run multiple times for different users):
   ```bash
   python3 src/securetext.py
   ```

3. **Create accounts** and start messaging to explore the application

## Security Warnings

**IMPORTANT**: The base application contains multiple intentional security and privacy vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are **by design** and will be addressed throughout the assignments.

## Assignment Workflow

For each assignment:

1. **Read the assignment instructions** in the respective `assignments/assignmentX/README.md`
2. **Implement your solutions** in the `assignments/assignmentX/deliverables/` folder
3. **Write your report** using the provided template and put it as a deliverable beside the codes
4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Assignment X Task Y"
   git push origin assignmentX-solutions
   ```
5. **Submit on Brightspace** with your GitHub repository fork link along with the report reuploaded on the Brightspace

## Tools You Might Need

### Network Analysis Tools
- **Wireshark** (GUI packet analyzer)
- **tcpdump** (command-line packet capture)
- **netstat** (network connection monitoring)

### Cryptographic Tools
- **hashcat** (password cracking)
- **OpenSSL** (cryptographic operations)
- **hash_extender** or **HashPump** (length extension attacks)

### Python Libraries
You may need to install additional Python packages.

## Documentation

Detailed extra setup documentation is available in the `docs/` folder, if needed:
- **Setup Guide**: Complete environment setup instructions

## Assessment Criteria

Each assignment will be evaluated on:
- **Technical Implementation** (40%): Correctness and completeness of solutions
- **Security Understanding** (30%): Depth of vulnerability analysis and countermeasures
- **Attack Demonstrations** (20%): Clear evidence of successful attacks
- **Overall Report Quality** (10%): Clarity, organization, and proper screenshot evidences

## Academic Integrity

- All work must be your own individual effort
- You may discuss concepts with classmates but not share code
- Use **GenAI** for help but do not let **GenAI** to do all the work and you should understand everything yourself
- If you used any **GenAI** help make sure you cite the contribution of **GenAI** properly
- Properly cite any external resources or libraries used
- Include your forked repository link in all submissions

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the `docs/` folder for detailed guides
- **Issues**: Post questions or report bugs or unclear instructions via GitHub Issues

## Important Notes

- Keep your repository private until after the course ends otherwise you receive zero on assignments
- Each assignment builds upon the previous one
- Start early - security implementations can be complex
- Test your solutions thoroughly
- Document your attacks with screenshots and logs

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab series, you will have:
- Built a secure messaging application from an insecure foundation
- Demonstrated real-world attack techniques
- Implemented modern authentication and cryptographic protocols
- Gained practical experience with security tools and methodologies
- Developed a security-first mindset for software development

Good luck!
